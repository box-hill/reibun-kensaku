# Reibun Kensaku
A powerful Japanese sentence search engine, capable of generating sentences better than any others on the web!

### [👉LIVE DEMO](https://reibun-kensaku.web.app/)

### 💡 Motivation 
My aim with this project was to create a Japanese learning tool for intermediate to advanced learners.  
  
Popular Japanese sentence seachers (such as yourei.jp) are very good at generating sentences from one word searches. However, they fail at generating sentences once that word is turned into a phrase.  
  
Where my website differs, is that it searches the web for example sentences. This means that anyone who writes a blog or tweets something can contribute to sentences generated. This results in stronger matches with context from a myriad of sources.  

Here's how my website compares to other sentence searchers:  
| Search        | RK       | Jisho | 
| ---:          | :---:    | :---: | 
| 美味しくなくない  | ⭕      | ❌      |
| ほんまに分からん  |  ⭕       | ❌    |
### 💪 Features
